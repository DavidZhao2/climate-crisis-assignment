        <h1 id="hero-title">What is a <em>hurricane</em>?</h1>
        <p>A <strong>hurricane</strong> is a massive storm system that forms over warm ocean waters. It features a rotating structure with a calm center called the <em>eye</em>, surrounded by powerful winds and heavy rainfall.</p>
        <p>Hurricanes are also known as tropical cyclones or typhoons in other parts of the world. They gain their energy from warm, moist air rising from the ocean, which fuels their rotation and intensity.</p>
        <p>These storms are classified on the <strong>Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale</strong>, which ranges from Category 1 (least severe) to Category 5 (most destructive). Hurricanes can cause storm surges, flooding, and widespread damage when they make landfall.</p>
